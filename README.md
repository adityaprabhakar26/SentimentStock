# SentimentStock
# This project is a collection of code used for my independent research project analyzing the relationship between stock price and sentiment, and seeing if we can predict stock price from sentiment from StockTwits
# There is a webscraper file, a few correlation ones back when I was trying linear regression, and then a few LSTM models I built
# The files are pretty messy since this was scrapy work from mid 2023, as it was my first experience with actually creating a project
