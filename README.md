# SentimentStock
This project is a collection of code used for my independent research project analyzing the relationship between stock price and sentiment, and seeing if we can predict stock price from sentiment from StockTwits

There is a webscraper file, a file which uses a HuggingFace NLP to analyze sentiment,a few correlation ones back when I was trying linear regression, and then a few LSTM models I built

The files are pretty messy since this was scrapy work from mid 2023, as it was my first experience with actually creating a project. Sorry about the mess, and how the structure is pretty flawed.
